# 3D3-P2
Simple app showing message recieving and sending over LAN
Requires entry of the destinations IP and Port
Wasnt able to test if recieving messages works on set-up emulator, but it works on phones
Also can recieve and send messages to other socket programmes such as the simple client and server.py scripts in the first commit of 3D3-group-work repo
